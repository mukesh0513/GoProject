# GoProject
Hello Junta

This is a golang project which read log files and answer queries related to json objects.

About files:

  - JsonFetching contains code to fetch json file, parse objects or details into required datatype.
  - dbReadCreate contains code which upload the parsed data to our database and answer various queries.
  - JsonStruct contain struct for structured data. json file corresponding to this struct is in log.json.
  - routes contain file which host different routes to the local server.
  - I am using unstructured json file here. And the corresponding json data is in newlog.json.
  - compile main.go to see the magic.

# Gracias
